## Setup

To install the project's dependencies, you can simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

As is common with Python projects, we highly recommend setting up a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. This ensures that your project's dependencies are isolated and won't interfere with other projects on your system. If you're not familiar with virtual environments, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for guidance.

### ImageMagick Installation

For using the function to add subtitles to a Video, you need ImageMagick.


#### For Linux Users:

If you're using a Linux-based operating system, you can install ImageMagick using the package manager. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
apt install imagemagick
```

#### For Windows Users:

For Windows users, the installation process is a bit different:

1. **Download**: First, download the ImageMagick installer from the official website: [ImageMagick Downloads](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)

2. **Installation**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

3. **Add to PATH**: After installation, make sure to add ImageMagick to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run ImageMagick commands from any directory. You can typically do this during the installation process, or you can manually add it afterwards. If you're not sure how to add to the PATH, you can refer to online tutorials or documentation specific to your version of Windows.

Once you've completed these steps, you should have everything set up to use the project effectively. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, feel free to ask for further assistance!
